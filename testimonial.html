Initially, we had no architect and only a DA for guidance so Kurt helped me brainstorm the macro design vision, which impressed me from the start as that was above and beyond his defined building scope.
Virginia Wong-See of "Architecture at Altitude" joined just before the start date, and Kurt quickly formed a close alliance to decide detailed design elements, sometimes just before implementation.
In spite of delays caused by my indecision, and constant last-minute change requests, Kurt remained professional and friendly to the very end.
Whilst all subcontractors were professional, I occasionally saw Kurt there on a Saturday personally polishing all the little things. (I never received a bill for that).
The speed and accuracy of Kurts' own beautiful artisan carpentry confirm his various industry awards and gave substance to his leadership.
The site was always left clean and my neighbors are unanimous in their praise for the humility and respect he showed our community.

Kurt is absolutely genuine, and my home transformation is a blessing for my family and testament to his skills, vision, and hard work.

I wouldn't do a build with anyone else.

Kurt and his team started on time as promised and delivered the most amazing work. They transformed our home into an amazing space that is everything we hoped for. The site was always immaculately tidy (we lived on site throughout!), all their trades were friendly and efficient, and the quality of workmanship was excellent. Throughout the process we changed our minds and they accommodated. They also came up with ideas and improvements along the way that improved on our original vision. Best of all, they finished on time and on budget with no dramas along the way - even managing to wrangle our four dogs throughout the process! We'd have no hesitation in recommending them for any project.");

It is seldom you hear a client rave about their builder - but we had the most amazing experience working with Kurt.

At the start of the build process, I was dubious that the project would be completed in the nominated time - not only did they finish within the set time, but a few weeks earlier than forecast.
I don't recall ever a raised voice with Kurt, who goes about the job with a professional & well managed manner.
Communication though out the process was clear, & always well documented.
The workmanship has been faultless. It has been almost 2 x years since the build was completed, & the quality of a build comes to light over that time - not once have I had to call vivid built to come back to fix anything, other than during the defect period post completion.

I would be happy to discuss our experience with any prospective client considering using Kurt.

My project was completed on time despite the termites and I found Kurt knowledgeable and obliging. 

Whilst I know Vivid Built have done a lot of large scale builds I have repeatedly recommended them to others with smaller/ medium builds because of my own positive experience. I recommend Kurt for his diligence to get the job done and attain a high standard in the process.

When there were options to be considered, Kurt was open and upfront and went out of his way to explain these options in detail.

Proven reputation in building 
In 2016 we had finished a major renovation when we decided that we needed more and looked to a second floor attic extension. This was always going to be a tricky job - we had limited access, we needed to live in, the plans were being done by a drafter not an architect to save costs and we had a cast iron budget which had no stretch at all. I had seen the work done by Vividbuild on a major house renovation in my street - one that had been very challenging structurally - and i had heard only good reports about them and  my neighbour had been so impressed by their manner and the results. I was very pleased when they agreed to take our job on.

Professional and efficient 
From the outset the job presented difficulties structurally and logistically but Kurt worked through these all and kept the plans on track and on budget. As often happens with an old house we found some unexpected issues but Kurt explained it so well and clearly that we could see exactly what the issue was and could see reasons for variations. To make matters very more challenging we were hit with some of the century's worst weather the minute the roof came off. Kurt worked tirelessly to keep the work moving and us as warm and dry as possible. 

innovation and Problem solving 
Throughout the job they helped us find some innovative solutions and also suggested some modifications that created extra storage and some clever features we had not even thought of. 
Through all of this we had a team working in our house as we went about our lives and at all times, even in the most challenging of situations (think pouring rain, flapping tarps and gale winds) - through all of this Kurt and whatever trades were there were polite, considerate, immaculate and helpful. They are true gentlemen to have around.

Attention to detail 
There were also times when attention to detail was everything. A tricky wooden staircase was done but the colour was not quite right and Kurt insisted that it be redone and he made sure it was exactly as intended. The quality of their work is unequalled and years on we have not had one single issue with leaks, paint work or the finishes.

On time and on budget 
This was a tricky and challenging job in an old house - but it produced a result that increased our home's living space and  value substantially for the investment. Thanks to VividBuild - this job was delivered on time, on budget, with exemplary workmanship and with care and attention to detail that exceeded our hopes and expectations.  The Vividbuild team are truly exceptional builders - and are professional in every aspect of their work and the delivery of a quality building result.

It is my pleasure to recommend the work of VividBuild and also would gladly answer questions to assist.
